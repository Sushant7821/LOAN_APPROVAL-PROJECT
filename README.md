##📌 Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a Decision Tree model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not, based on personal and financial attributes like age, income, credit card usage, etc.

This helps financial institutions automate and improve the efficiency of their loan approval process by leveraging data-driven decision making.

##🧠 Project Highlights
Cleaned and explored a real-world loan dataset

Handled missing values and dropped irrelevant features

Visualized relationships between features and target

Trained and tuned a Decision Tree Classifier

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualized the tree structure and confusion matrix

##🛠️ Tech Stack Used
Tool/Library	Purpose
Pandas	Data loading & preprocessing
NumPy	Numerical operations
Matplotlib, Seaborn	Data visualization
Scikit-learn	Model training, tuning & evaluation

##📊 Visualizations Included
#🔥 Correlation Heatmap

#🧮 Age vs Credit Card Usage Scatter Plot

#✅ Confusion Matrix

#🌳 Visualized Decision Tree

#✅ Model Evaluation
#📉 Train Accuracy (Tuned): 98.69%

#📈 Test Accuracy (Tuned): 98.47%

#🎯 Precision:

Class 0 (Loan Not Approved): 0.99

Class 1 (Loan Approved): 0.90

#🔁 Recall:

Class 0: 0.99

Class 1: 0.95

#📊 F1-Score:

Class 0: 0.99

Class 1: 0.92

##📌 Overall Accuracy: 98.47%

#📚 Macro Avg F1-Score: 0.96

#📚 Weighted Avg F1-Score: 0.98

This means your model is very accurate and does a great job identifying both approved and rejected loans.

##🧾 Conclusion
This beginner-friendly machine learning project demonstrates how to:

Handle and clean real-world financial data

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Build and tune a classification model

Evaluate with meaningful metrics

Interpret and visualize model results

You can try improving the model using ensemble techniques like Random Forest or XGBoost for even better performance.
